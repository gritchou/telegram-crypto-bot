# Telegram Binance Bot

A bot that can retrieve coins prices.

## Setup

Set your variables:

- `BOT_TOKEN` (set is as an environment variable): the Token given by BotFather you when you create your bot on Telegram.
- `API_KEY` (set is as an environment variable): Your Binance API key.
- `API_SECRET` (set is as an environment variable): Your Binance API secret.

## Vercel

I use vercel to host my bot.
Follow [this](https://www.marclittlemore.com/serverless-telegram-chatbot-vercel/) really cool tutorial from [@marclittlemore](https://twitter.com/marclittlemore).
As he suggests, I used ngrok to test vercel's serveless function locally.
